#summary A conceptual overview of GWT explaining how it is unique and why it works so well
=Google Web Toolkit Overview=

Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is an open source Java development framework that lets you escape the matrix of technologies that make writing AJAX applications so difficult and error prone. With GWT, you can develop and debug AJAX applications in the Java language using the Java development tools of your choice. When you deploy your application to production, the GWT compiler translates your Java application to browser-compliant !JavaScript and HTML.

Here's the GWT development cycle:

 # Use your favorite Java IDE to write and debug an application in the Java language, using as many (or as few) GWT libraries as you find useful.
 # Use GWT's Java-to-!JavaScript compiler to distill your application into a set of !JavaScript and HTML files that you can serve with any web server.
 # Confirm that your application works in each browser that you want to support, which usually takes no additional work.
