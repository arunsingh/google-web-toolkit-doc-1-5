=RPC Error: javax.servlet.!ServletException: Content-Type must be text/plain=

When upgrading from GWT 1.4 to GWT 1.5 you may see a stack trace similar to the following:

{{{
$PP_OFF
javax.servlet.ServletException: Content-Type must be 'text/plain' with 'charset=utf-8' (or unspecified charset)
        at com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.RemoteServiceServlet.readPayloadAsUtf8(RemoteServiceServlet.java: 119)
        at com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.RemoteServiceServlet.doPost(RemoteServiceServlet.java: 178)
        at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java: 738)
        at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java: 831)
        ...
}}}

The likely reason for this problem is that the RPC content type was switched from `text/plain` in GWT 1.4 to `text/x-gwt-rpc` in GWT 1.5.  If your server is complaining that the content type is not `text/plain` then your server is still using a GWT 1.4
`gwt-servlet.jar`.  Updating your server to use the GWT 1.5 `gwt-servlet.jar`
will fix it.
