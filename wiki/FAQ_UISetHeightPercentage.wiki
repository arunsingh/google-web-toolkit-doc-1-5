#summary Why doesn't setting a widget's height as a percentage work?

= Why doesn't setting a widget's height as a percentage work? =

In some cases, `Widget.setHeight(String)` or `Widget.setSize(String,String)` method does 
not seem to work with sizes expressed as percentages.  The GWT widgets do not do any calculatinos with these values - these methods set the widget'' CSS width and height properties and depend on the container widget's behavior.  

   1 Try changing your enclosing widget to a different type.  !VerticalPanel is
implemented with a `<table>` element and might behave differently from !AbsolutePanel
which is implemented with a `<div>`
   2 If you have a `<DOCTYPE...>` declaration HTML host page setting the app into
Standards mode, you might try removing the `<DOCTYPE ...>` declaration to put the
browser rendering engine into quirks mode.
