=Unit Testing=

Creating a battery of good unit test cases is an important part of ensuring the quality of your application over its lifecycle.  To aid developers with their testing efforts, GWT provides integration with the popular [http://www.junit.org JUnit] unit testing framework.  GWT allows JUnit test cases to run in either hosted mode or web mode, and also provides a benchmarking facility to help you understand the performance characteristics of the components of your application.
