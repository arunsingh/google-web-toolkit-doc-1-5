#summary Defining rules to create your own classes that use Deferred Binding

=Defining Deferred Binding Rules=

There are two techniques for implementing deferred binding:

 * [DevGuideDeferredBindingReplacement Replacement]: One class is replaced with another depending on a condition.
 * [DevGuideDeferredBindingGenerators Generators]: A set of derived classes is automaticaly generated and subsequently replaced depending on a condition.


==Directives in Module XML files==

The deferred binding mechanism is completely configurable and does not require editing the GWT distributed source code.  Deferred binding is configured through the `<replace-with>` and `<generate-with>` elements in the [DevGuideModuleXml module XML files].  The deferred binding rules are pulled into the module build through `<inherits>` elements.

For example, the following configuration invokes deferred binding for the  [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/PopupPanel.html PopupPanel] widget:

 * Top level _<module>_.gwt.xml _*inherits*_ [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/user/src/com/google/gwt/user/User.gwt.xml com.google.gwt.user.User]
 * [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/user/src/com/google/gwt/user/User.gwt.xml com/google/gwt/user/User.gwt.xml] _*inherits*_ [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/user/src/com/google/gwt/user/Popup.gwt.xml com.google.gwt.user.Popup]
 * [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/user/src/com/google/gwt/user/Popup.gwt.xml com/google/gwt/user/Popup.gwt.xml] _*contains*_ `<replace-with>` elements to define deferred binding rules for the [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/PopupPanel.html PopupPanel] class.

Inside the [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/PopupPanel.html PopupPanel] module XML file, there happens to be some rules defined for deferred binding. In this case, we're using the [DevGuideDeferredBindingReplacement Replacement] rule.
