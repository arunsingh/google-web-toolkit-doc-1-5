= Will I have to upgrade my application when a new version of GWT is released? =

We'll release new versions of GWT on the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ GWT web site]. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect to keep all previous versions of GWT available on the web site as well. As releases become outdated, we'll no longer actively support them on the [http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit GWT discussion group], but we'll do our best to keep old releases and documentation around as long as possible.
