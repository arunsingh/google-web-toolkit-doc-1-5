#summary Download and install GWT

=Install GWT=

==Install the Java SDK==

If you don't have a recent version of the Java SDK installed (version 1.5 or higher), download and install the [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/ Sun Java Standard Edition SDK].

==Download GWT==

Download the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html GWT distribution] for your operating system.
  
==Unzip the GWT distribution==

On Windows, extract the files from `gwt-windows-1.5.2.zip` with a program like [http://www.winzip.com/ WinZip].

On Mac, you can unpack the distribution with a command like:

{{{
$PP_OFF
tar xvzf gwt-mac-1.5.2.tar.gz
}}}

On Linux, use the command:

{{{
$PP_OFF
tar xvf gwt-linux-1.5.2.tar.bz2
}}}

That's all there is to it!  GWT doesn't use an installer application; all the files you need to run and use GWT are located in the extracted directory.

==Add the GWT application directory to your PATH==

For convenience when using the command line utilities, you should add the directory where you unpacked the GWT distribution to your system path. 

For Windows users perform the following steps:

 * Right-click on _My Computer_ and select _Properties_
 * Open the _Advanced_ tab
 * Click the _Environment Variables_ button
 * Select _Path_ from the user variables list and click _Edit_
 * At the end of the of the variable value, add a semicolon followed by the full path to the directory where you unpacked the GWT distribution (e.g., `;C:\gwt-windows-1.5.2\`)

On Mac or Linux you will need to edit a file named `.profile` or `.bash_profile` in your home directory.  For example, if you unpacked GWT in `/home/user/gwt-linux-1.5.2/`, update your profile as follows:

{{{
$PP_OFF
PATH=$PATH:/home/user/gwt-linux-1.5.2/
export PATH
}}}

You will need to log out of your account and log back in before the PATH setting takes effect (Linux and Mac).
