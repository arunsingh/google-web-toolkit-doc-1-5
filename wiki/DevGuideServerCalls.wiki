#summary Make calls to backend servers using GWT RPC or direct HTTP. 

=Communicating with a server=

At some point, most GWT applications will need to interact with a backend server.  GWT provides a couple of different ways to communicate with a server via HTTP.  You can use the [DevGuideRemoteProcedureCalls GWT RPC] framework to transparently make calls to Java servlets and let GWT take care of low-level details like object serialization.  Alternatively, you can use GWT's  [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/http/client/package-summary.html HTTP client classes] to build and send custom HTTP requests.

==Specifics==

[DevGuideRemoteProcedureCalls GWT RPC]
An easy-to-use RPC mechanism for passing Java objects to and from a server over standard HTTP.

[DevGuideHttp HTTP Calls]
For more fine-grained control, [DevGuideHttpRequests make custom HTTP requests] and optionally process the responses using GWT's [DevGuideJSON JSON] and [DevGuideXML XML] client classes.
