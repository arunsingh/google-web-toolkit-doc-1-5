#summary Command-line script that compiles a GWT module's Java source into equivalent deployable JavaScript.

=Compile Script=
The compile script is a command-line script that compiles a GWT module and creates !JavaScript to deploy an application in [DevGuideWebMode web mode]. If you use [DevGuideApplicationCreator applicationCreator] to generate a sample project in the standard layout, it generates an application-specific compile script prefixed with the module name: `<module>-compile`.

The following is a full list of command-line arguments you can pass to the GWT compiler:

{{{
$PP_OFF
GWTCompiler [-logLevel level] [-gen dir] [-out dir] [-treeLogger] [-style style] [-ea] [-validateOnly] [module]
}}}

|| *Argument* || *Description* ||
|| -logLevel `<`level`>` || Sets the level of logging detail: ERROR, WARN, INFO, TRACE, DEBUG, SPAM, or ALL. ||
|| -gen `<`directory`>` || Specifies the directory into which generated files will be written for review. ||
|| -out `<`directory`>` || Specifies the directory to write output files into. (Defaults to current.) ||
|| -treeLogger || Logs output in a graphical tree view. ||
|| -style || Sets the script output style: OBF`[`USCATED`]`, PRETTY, or DETAILED (defaults to OBF). || 
|| -ea || Debugging: causes the compiled output to check assert statements. ||
|| -validateOnly || Validate all source code, but do not compile. ||
|| `<`module`>`  || Names of modules to compile. ||

Any arguments at the end of the command-line are assumed to be names of modules (Java class names with their full package names) to compile.
