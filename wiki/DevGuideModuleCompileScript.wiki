#summary Command-line script that compiles a GWT module's Java source into equivalent deployable JavaScript.

==<module>-compile Script==

The `<module>-compile` script is a command-line program that compiles a GWT module and creates !JavaScript to deploy an application in [DevGuideWebMode web mode].  This script is created by the [DevGuideApplicationCreator applicationCreator] tool used to generate a sample project in the standard layout.

The following is a full list of command-line arguments you can pass to the GWT compiler:

{{{
$PP_OFF
GWTCompiler [-logLevel level] [-gen dir] [-out dir] [-treeLogger] [-style style] [-ea] [-validateOnly] module
}}}

|| `-logLevel <level>` || The level of logging detail: ERROR, WARN, INFO, TRACE, DEBUG, SPAM, or ALL ||
|| `-gen <directory>` || The directory into which generated files will be written for review ||
|| `-out <directory>` || The directory to write output files into (defaults to current) ||
|| `-treeLogger` || Logs output in a graphical tree view ||
|| `-style` || Script output style: OBF`[`USCATED`]`, PRETTY, or DETAILED (defaults to OBF) || 
|| `-ea` || Debugging: causes the compiled output to check assert statements. ||
|| `-validateOnly` || Validate all source code, but do not compile. ||

Any arguments at the end of the command-line are assumed to be names of modules (java class names with their full package names) to compile.
