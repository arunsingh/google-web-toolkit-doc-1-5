This guide is a tutorial that takes you step-by-step through creating your first GWT application, a simple stock watch list that we'll call "!StockWatcher".  As we build the application, you'll learn about each of the major features of GWT, including the widget library, hosted mode debugging, remote procedure calls, internationalization, and lots more.
