#summary Command-line script that launches an application in Hosted mode for debugging.

=Hosted Mode Shell Script=
The hosted mode shell script is a command-line script that runs a GWT module in [DevGuideHostedMode hosted mode]. If you use [DevGuideApplicationCreator applicationCreator] to generate a sample project in the standard layout, it generates an application-specific shell script prefixed with the module name: `<module>-shell`.

The following is a full list of command-line arguments you can pass to the Development Shell:

{{{
$PP_OFF
GWTShell [-port port-number | "auto"] [-noserver] [-whitelist whitelist-string] [-blacklist blacklist-string] 
  [-logLevel level] [-gen dir] [-out dir] [-style style] [-ea] [url]
}}}

|| *Argument* || *Description* ||
|| -out `<`directory`>` || Specifies the directory to write output files into. (Defaults to current.) ||
|| -port `<`port number`>` || Changes the default port number of the embedded Tomcat server.  If "auto" is specified, a random unused port number will be used. ||
|| -noserver || Prevents the embedded Tomcat server from running, even if a port is specified. ||
|| -whitelist `<`regex list`>`||  Allows the user to browse URLs that match the specified regexes (comma or space separated). ||
|| -blacklist `<`regex list`>`||  Prohibits the user from browsing URLs that match the specified regexes (comma or space separated). ||
|| -logLevel `<`level`>` || Sets the level of logging detail: ERROR, WARN, INFO, TRACE, DEBUG, SPAM, or ALL. ||
|| -gen `<`directory`>` || Specifieds the directory into which generated files will be written for review. ||
|| -style || Sets the script output style: OBF`[`USCATED`]`, PRETTY, or DETAILED (defaults to OBF). || 
|| -ea ||  Debugging: causes the compiled output to check assert statements. ||
|| `<`url`>` || Automatically launches the specified URL. ||

Any arguments at the end of the command-line are assumed to be URLs used to launch the hosted browser.
