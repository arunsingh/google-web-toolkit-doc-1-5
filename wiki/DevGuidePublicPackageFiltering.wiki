#summary Filter files into and out of your public path and source path to avoid publishing files unintentionally.

=Filtering Public and Source Packages=

The [DevGuideModuleXml module XML format's] `<public>`, `<source>` and `<super-source>` elements supports certain attributes and nested elements to allow pattern-based inclusion and exclusion in the [DevGuideModules public path].  These elements follow the same rules as [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant]'s `FileSet` element. Please see the [http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTypes/fileset.html documentation] for `FileSet` for a general overview.  These elements do not support the full `FileSet` semantics. Only the following attributes and nested elements are currently supported: 

  * The `includes` attribute
  * The `excludes` attribute
  * The `defaultexcludes` attribute
  * The `casesensitive` attribute
  * Nested `include` tags
  * Nested `exclude` tags

Other attributes and nested elements are not supported. 

===Important===
The default value of `defaultexcludes` is `true`. By default, the patterns listed [http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#defaultexcludes here] are excluded.
