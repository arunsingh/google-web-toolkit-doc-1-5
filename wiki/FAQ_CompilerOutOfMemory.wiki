#summary The GWT compiler reports java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

= GWT Compiler reports java.lang.!OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space =

When compiling a project in GWT 1.5 or later, you may start to encounter problems with running out of memory:

{{{
$PP_OFF
Compiling permutations
   Analyzing permutation #1
      [ERROR] An internal compiler exception occurred
com.google.gwt.dev.jjs.InternalCompilerException: Unexpected error during visit.
        at ...
Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
}}}


The underlying issue is that GWT 1.5 has introduced a number of compiler optimizations that require more memory and processing power, not to mention a larger library (in `gwt-user.jar`) that must be analyzed during the compilation phase.  This can cause the compiler to exceed the default JVM heap size.

To solve this problem, increase the Java heap limit.  You can do this by adding the Java VM argument `-Xmx256M` to the Java command line to increase the limit to 256 megabytes.  Increase the number `256` to a higher value if your compilation still requires more RAM.
