#summary Useful command-line tools for getting started.

=Command-line Tools=

GWT includes a set of scripts that can be run from the command-line.  Many of these are tools which generate new files, to quickly get a project off the ground.  They can also be used to add new things to existing projects. For example, `projectCreator` can be used to make an Eclipse project for one of the samples that comes with GWT, and `junitCreator` can be used to add a new unit test to an existing project.
